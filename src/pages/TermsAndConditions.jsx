          <h2>Verification</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hruday Sparsha Vivaha Mandal may provide a "verification tick" on a profile after comparing documents provided
              by the customer with profile information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Verification is limited to the documents provided and does not extend to information without documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hruday Sparsha Vivaha Mandal accepts documents as provided and is not responsible if documents are forged,
              false, incorrect or tampered.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is not Hruday Sparsha Vivaha Mandal's responsibility to independently verify document validity (for
              example degree certificates).
            </li>
            <li>
              The verification tick is not a guarantee or surety. Customers remain responsible for cross-checking validity
              of documents even if another member shows a verification tick. Documents will not be provided to third parties.
            </li>
          </ul>
